My initial idea was scrapped as I couldn't figure out how to get the timestamp requirement for the api figured out. Pivoted to a simpler idea that utilized the Pokemon API. The new project idea circles around the idea of a sticker collection book but in digital form and for one's Pokemon card collection. Due to limited time after pivoting to the new idea, full functionality hasn't been implemented but the basic framework, including functional API calls, is in place.
